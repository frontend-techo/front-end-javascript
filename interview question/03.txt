1. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.**
  Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, allowing them to be used before they are declared.

2. **What are arrow functions in JavaScript? How are they different from regular functions?**
  Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They have a more concise syntax, and they do not bind their own `this` value, instead inheriting the `this` value from the enclosing lexical scope.

3. **What is a callback function? Can you provide an example of using a callback?**
  A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. An example of using a callback is with asynchronous operations like `setTimeout()`:

function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
   setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("Async operation completed");
    callback();
   }, 1000);
  }
  function afterAsync() {
   console.log("After async operation");
  }
  doSomethingAsync(afterAsync);


4. **What are the differences between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` in JavaScript?**
  - `localStorage`: Data stored in `localStorage` persists even after the browser is closed and is accessible across tabs and windows of the same domain.
  - `sessionStorage`: Data stored in `sessionStorage` is available only during the session and is lost when the session ends or the browser is closed.

5. **Explain the concept of event delegation and why it is useful.**
  Event delegation is a technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element instead of individual child elements. This is useful for improving performance and memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of dynamically generated elements, as it avoids adding event listeners to each individual element.

6. **What are the different ways to include CSS styles in an HTML document?**
  CSS styles can be included in an HTML document through:
  - Inline styles using the `style` attribute.
  - Internal styles using the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section.
  - External styles by linking an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag.

7. **What are the different ways to loop over an array in JavaScript?**
  JavaScript offers several ways to loop over an array:
  - `for` loop
  - `forEach()` method
  - `for...of` loop
  - `map()` method
  - `filter()` method
