Priya: Memoization is a technique used to optimize functions by caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing those results when the same inputs occur again. It helps improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.

Priya: Of course. Imagine you have a recursive function that calculates Fibonacci numbers. Without memoization, the same values are recalculated multiple times, leading to exponential time complexity. By memoizing the results, you store the calculated values in memory, reducing the number of redundant calculations and significantly improving the function's efficiency.

Priya: Memoization typically involves using a data structure like an object or a map to store the results of function calls. When the function is called again with the same arguments, it first checks if the result is already stored in the cache. If it is, the cached result is returned instead of recalculating. If not, the function calculates the result and stores it in the cache for future use.
In JavaScript, you can implement memoization using closures or by creating a higher-order function that wraps the original function with caching logic.

Priya: Yes, there are a few considerations. Memoization can increase memory usage, especially if the cache becomes very large. It's important to balance the benefits of performance improvement with the additional memory consumption. Additionally, memoization is most effective for functions with repetitive and expensive computations. For functions with simple and quick calculations, the overhead of caching might outweigh the benefits.
