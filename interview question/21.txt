Interviewer: Can you start by explaining what CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is?

Priya: CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control requests made from one domain (origin) to another domain. It's a mechanism that allows or restricts web pages in one domain from making requests for resources on a different domain. This is an important security measure to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.

Interviewer: Well explained. Why is CORS necessary? Could you elaborate on the security concerns it addresses?

Priya: Absolutely. Imagine if any website could freely make requests to resources on other websites, like accessing user data or performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent. That would be a significant security risk. CORS prevents such unauthorized cross-origin requests, ensuring that only websites that have been explicitly permitted can access resources from other domains. This prevents potential data breaches and unauthorized actions.

Interviewer: Great. Could you explain how CORS works? How does a server indicate that it allows cross-origin requests?

Priya: Certainly. When a browser sends a cross-origin request, the server should include specific HTTP headers in its response to indicate whether the request is allowed. The main header is "Access-Control-Allow-Origin," which specifies which domains are allowed to access the resource. Servers can use a wildcard * to allow any domain or list specific domains.

Interviewer: Good point. What happens when a cross-origin request is denied by the server due to CORS restrictions?

Priya: If a cross-origin request is denied due to CORS restrictions, the browser's same-origin policy kicks in. This policy prevents the web page from accessing the response data, including any potential error messages. The browser's JavaScript code won't be able to interact with the response unless the server explicitly allows the requesting domain.

Interviewer: Makes sense. Are there any scenarios where CORS might not apply?

Priya: Yes, there are. CORS restrictions apply only to web browsers. If you're making requests from a server-side script (like Node.js) or a mobile app, CORS doesn't apply. Browsers enforce CORS to ensure that potentially sensitive data doesn't get exposed to unauthorized websites.
